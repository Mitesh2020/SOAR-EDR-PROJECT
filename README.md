### **Key Terminologies Before Starting the Project**  

1. **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)**  
   - **Description**: SOAR platforms automate security workflows by integrating various security tools, enabling faster and more efficient incident response.  
   - **Use Case**: Automating phishing email analysis by extracting indicators, checking them against threat intelligence feeds, and triggering a response.  

2. **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**  
   - **Description**: EDR solutions continuously monitor endpoints for suspicious activities, detect threats in real time, and provide automated or manual response options.  
   - **Use Case**: Detecting a compromised laptop executing malicious scripts and automatically isolating it from the network.  

3. **Tines (SOAR Platform)**  
   - **Description**: A no-code SOAR platform that enables security teams to create automated workflows for incident response, threat intelligence, and security monitoring.  
   - **Use Case**: Automating security alert triage by collecting data from SIEMs, enriching it with threat intelligence, and escalating critical alerts.  

4. **LimaCharlie (EDR & Security Infrastructure)**  
   - **Description**: A cloud-native security operations platform providing EDR, log collection, automation, and security tooling as a service.  
   - **Use Case**: Deploying LimaCharlie agents across an enterprise to detect and respond to endpoint threats in real-time.  

5. **Slack (Collaboration & Incident Communication)**  
   - **Description**: A messaging platform used by security teams for real-time collaboration, alerting, and incident response coordination.  
   - **Use Case**: Integrating Slack with SOAR tools like Tines to automatically notify security teams when a critical security event occurs.
